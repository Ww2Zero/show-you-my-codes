Donald Trump claimed on Thursday that his administration is 'running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I cannot get my cabinet approved.'

He ignored a week which saw him fire his national security adviser for lying to the vice president, and a mounting tide of leaks from inside his White House and his intelligence agencies – instead turning on the media.

The president complained that the national press corps continues to portray his work unfairly, suggesting that dishonest reporters are responsible for the lack of credit he gets from the public.

'I turn on the TV, open the newspapers – and I see stories of chaos, chaos,' Trump complained in his first solo press conference since taking over the Oval Office. 'Yet it is the exact opposite.' 'Much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York and Los Angeles speaks not for the people, but for the special interests,' he claimed.

He took direct aim at the cable news network, saying both that he watches it and can no longer stomach its bias.
